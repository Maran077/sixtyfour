# React Dashboard UI

## Description

This project is a React dashboard UI implemented using Vite, TypeScript, and React Icons. It provides a user-friendly interface for displaying content cards, managing sidebar navigation, and implementing features such as expand/collapse and "Load More".

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-dashboard-ui.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-dashboard-ui
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/components`: Contains React components for the sidebar, main content area, and individual UI elements.
- `src/assets`: Contains static assets such as images and icons.

## Usage

### Sidebar Component

The sidebar component handles the expand/collapse feature and displays sidebar items. Clicking on the toggle button expands or collapses the sidebar.

### Content Card Component

The content card component displays a card with a title, description, and image. It is used to represent individual items in the main content area.

### Load More Feature

The "Load More" feature allows users to load additional content cards dynamically. Initially, a subset of cards is displayed, and clicking the "Load More" button increases the number of items shown.

### Responsiveness

The layout is designed to be responsive using CSS media queries. It adjusts automatically to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

### Error Handling

Error boundaries in React are used for handling errors. Friendly error messages are displayed to the user in case of error scenarios.

### UI/UX Improvements

The design follows a consistent color scheme and typography for a pleasant user experience. Hover effects are added to buttons and clickable items for better user feedback.

### Static Assets

Placeholder images and icons are used as static assets.

## Testing

To test the project, ensure to:

- Verify the expand/collapse feature of the sidebar.
- Test the functionality of the "Load More" button.
- Check responsiveness on different devices.
- Simulate error scenarios to ensure proper error handling.

## Review and Refinement

Go through the UI and compare it with the design specifications. Pay attention to spacing, padding, and alignment. Look for opportunities to further improve the user experience, such as implementing dark mode or animations.
